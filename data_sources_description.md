#### RKI
The German Robert Koch Institute [(RKI)](https://www.rki.de/DE/Home/homepage_node.html) is an independent higher federal authority and reports directly to the Federal Ministry
of Health. As a public health institution (Federal Institute for Infectious Diseases and Noncommunicable Diseases),
it has the health of the entire population in mind and is a central research institution of the Federal Republic of Germany. - [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Koch-Institut)

The Robert Koch Institute continuously records the current COVID-19 situation, assesses all information and estimates
the risk for the population in Germany. In addition, the RKI provides comprehensive recommendations for the expert 
public and gives an overview of its own research projects. - [www.rki.de](https://www.rki.de/DE/Home/homepage_node.html)

#### Intensive registry
The [DIVI](https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index) Intensive Care Register records the free and occupied treatment 
capacities in intensive care medicine of about 1,300 acute hospitals in Germany on a daily basis. In the context of 
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, current case numbers of COVID-19 patients treated in intensive care are also recorded. [www.intensivregister.de](https://www.intensivregister.de/#/index)

The DIVI Intensive Care Register is a real-time data collection and analysis environment for intensive care bed 
capacities and aggregated case numbers for Germany. It is operated in collaboration between the German Interdisciplinary 
Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) as a public benefit 
oriented project. [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIVI-Intensivregister)
